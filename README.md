# Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Against Pregnant Women
This repository contains the supplementary materials of "Mining electronic health records to identify synergistic health correlates of intimate partner violence against pregnant women".

### Supplementary Data 1 - Raw Data

[Supplementary Data 1](supplementary_data_1.xlsx) contains the frequencies of all 18863 terms for all analyzed cohorts including Background (BG), Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), Pregnant (Preg), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Miscarriage (MC), Endometriosis (Endo), Intra-Uterine Device (IUD).

### Supplementary Data 2 - Terms that are prevalent in a single cohort

[Supplementary Data 2](supplementary_data_2.xlsx) contains the results of the prevalence analysis separately for all cohorts: IPV, Preg, CKD, MC, Endo, IUD. The term identified as prevalent here exhibit increased frequency in the population when present together with the corresponding condition.

### Supplementary Data 3 - Terms that are prevalent in IPV and Preg cohorts

[Supplementary Data 3](supplementary_data_3.xlsx) contains the results of the prevalence analysis for IPV and pregnancy. The terms identified here are prevalent in both IPV and Preg cohorts. Thus, the terms identified here exhibit increased frequency in the presense of both IPV and pregnancy (though not necessarily together). 

### Supplementary Data 4 - Terms that are prevalent for all cohort pairs of interest

[Supplementary Data 4](supplementary_data_4.xlsx) contains the results of the prevalence analysis for all cohort pairs of interest: IPV-Preg, IPV-CKD, IPV-MC, IPV-Endo, IPV-IUD, Preg-CKD, Preg-MC, Preg-Endo, Preg-IUD. The terms identified here for cohort pair X-Y is prevalent for X and Y cohorts. Thus, the terms identified here exhibit increased frequency in the presense of both X and Y (though not necessarily together). 

### Supplementary Data 5 - Terms that are synergistic for IPV and pregnancy

[Supplementary Data 5](supplementary_data_5.xlsx) contains the results of the synergy analysis for IPV and pregnancy. The terms identified here are more frequent in IPV&Preg cohort compared to their individual frequencies in IPV and Preg cohorts. Thus, the terms identified here exhibit increased frequency specifically when both IPV and pregnancy are present together.
